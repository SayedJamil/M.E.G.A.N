# M.E.G.A.N

The M.E.G.A.N stack is a modern web development stack that consists of four key technologies, namely MongoDB, Express.js, GraphQL, and Apollo GraphQL, along with Node.js as the server-side runtime environment.

This stack combines the power of NoSQL databases, server-side JavaScript, and a flexible data query language to create scalable and efficient web applications.

MongoDB provides a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, Express.js is a powerful and popular web framework for Node.js, GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows for efficient and flexible data fetching, and Apollo GraphQL is a set of tools and server-side components for building GraphQL APIs.

By combining these technologies, developers can create powerful and flexible web applications that can be easily extended and scaled.

## Tech Stack
